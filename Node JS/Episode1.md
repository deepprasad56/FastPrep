## Episode 1

### Introduction
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.  
- It has an **event-driven architecture**.  
- It uses **non-blocking I/O**.  
- Developed by **Ryan Dahl in 2009**.  

---

### History
- Initially, Node.js used **SpiderMonkey** (Firefox's JS engine).  
- Within 2 days, Ryan switched to **V8** because of its performance and modern features.  
- **Joyent** partnered with Ryan Dahl to build Node.js as they were working on a similar project.  
- Initially named **Web.js**, later renamed to **Node.js** due to scalability.

### Why Node.js?
- Before Node.js, **Apache HTTP Server** was widely used, which had **blocking I/O**.  
- Node.js solved this problem with its **non-blocking I/O** and event loop.

- **2012** – Ryan Dahl left the project, Isaac (founder of npm) took over.  
- **2014** – **Fedor** created **io.js** (a fork of Node.js).  
- **2015** – Fedor and Joyent merged **Node.js** and **io.js**, maintained by the **Node.js Foundation**.
